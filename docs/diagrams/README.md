# Stitched Up Companion - Diagrams

This directory contains architectural and flow diagrams for the Stitched Up Companion application, providing visual documentation of the project structure, data model, and interaction patterns.

## Available Diagrams

1. [**Project Architecture**](project-architecture.md) - Overview of the application structure, components, and data flow
2. [**User Interaction Flow**](user-interaction-flow.md) - How users navigate through the application and interact with different components
3. [**Directory Structure**](directory-structure.md) - Organization of files and directories in the project
4. [**Data Model**](data-model.md) - Structure of the data entities and relationships between them
5. [**State Management**](state-management.md) - How state is managed and how components interact with each other

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid.js syntax, which can be rendered in several ways:

1. **GitHub**: If you're viewing these files on GitHub, the diagrams should render automatically.
2. **VS Code**: Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension to view diagrams directly in VS Code's Markdown preview.
3. **Mermaid Live Editor**: Copy the diagram code into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to view and edit them.
4. **Browser Extension**: Various browser extensions can render Mermaid diagrams in Markdown files.

## Purpose of These Diagrams

These diagrams serve several important purposes for the project:

1. **Documentation**: They provide visual documentation of how the application works, making it easier for new developers to understand the system.

2. **Architecture Reference**: They serve as a reference for the intended architecture, helping ensure that new code follows the established patterns.

3. **Communication Tool**: They can be used to communicate the project structure to stakeholders or team members who may not be familiar with the codebase.

4. **Planning Aid**: They can help in planning new features by showing how they would fit into the existing architecture.

## Updating the Diagrams

As the application evolves, these diagrams should be updated to reflect changes in the architecture, data model, or interaction patterns. When making significant changes to the application, consider updating the relevant diagrams to maintain accurate documentation.

To modify a diagram:

1. Edit the Mermaid code in the corresponding markdown file
2. Test the new diagram using one of the rendering methods mentioned above
3. Commit the changes to the repository
