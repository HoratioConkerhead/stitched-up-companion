# Stitched Up Companion - Diagram Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of all the architectural and flow diagrams for the Stitched Up Interactive Companion application.

## Project Overview

The Stitched Up Interactive Companion is a web application designed to help readers explore Matt Parry's spy thriller novel "Stitched Up." The application allows users to navigate characters, relationships, locations, events, and plot elements from the novel through an interactive interface organized into tabs.

## Diagram Types and Their Purpose

### 1. Project Architecture Diagram

**Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive view of the application's structure, components, and their relationships.

**Key Elements**:
- Main container component (App.js)
- Tab components for different aspects of the novel
- Data structure and flow
- Component features
- State management and cross-component communication

**Insights**:
- Shows the hierarchical structure of the application
- Illustrates how data flows from data files to components
- Maps features to specific components
- Demonstrates the central role of state management in enabling cross-component communication

### 2. User Interaction Flow Diagram

**Purpose**: Illustrates how users navigate through the application and interact with different components.

**Key Elements**:
- Initial entry and welcome flow
- Tab navigation
- Actions within each tab
- Cross-tab interactions
- Selection panel usage

**Insights**:
- Shows common user journeys through the application
- Highlights how users can navigate between related content
- Demonstrates the role of the Current Selections panel in facilitating exploration
- Illustrates the interconnectedness of different views

### 3. Directory Structure Diagram

**Purpose**: Maps the organization of files and directories in the project, providing a guide to the codebase.

**Key Elements**:
- Root level files and directories
- Source code organization
- Component files
- Data files
- Configuration files

**Insights**:
- Shows the modular organization of the codebase
- Highlights the separation of concerns (components, data, styling)
- Demonstrates the organization of novel-specific data
- Provides a guide for locating specific files

### 4. Data Model Diagram

**Purpose**: Documents the structure of data entities and the relationships between them.

**Key Elements**:
- Character data structure
- Location data structure
- Event data structure
- Relationships between entities
- Map positions

**Insights**:
- Shows the rich interconnectedness of the novel's elements
- Illustrates how different entities relate to each other
- Provides a reference for the data model that powers the application
- Highlights the central role of relationships in the data model

### 5. State Management Diagram

**Purpose**: Shows how state is managed and how components interact with each other through the application's state.

**Key Elements**:
- Application initialization
- Selection flows for different entity types
- Cross-reference navigation
- Tab switching

**Insights**:
- Demonstrates the central role of App.js in state management
- Shows how user actions propagate through the component hierarchy
- Illustrates common interaction patterns
- Highlights the role of the Current Selections panel

## How the Diagrams Work Together

These diagrams provide complementary views of the application:

1. The **Project Architecture** diagram provides a static view of the application structure.
2. The **User Interaction Flow** diagram shows dynamic user journeys through the application.
3. The **Directory Structure** diagram maps where different components and data files are located.
4. The **Data Model** diagram illustrates the relationships between different types of data.
5. The **State Management** diagram shows how components communicate and share state.

Together, these diagrams provide a comprehensive understanding of how the Stitched Up Interactive Companion works, from high-level architecture to detailed interaction patterns.

## Using These Diagrams

- **For New Developers**: Start with the Project Architecture diagram to get an overview, then explore the Directory Structure to find your way around the codebase.
- **For Feature Planning**: Use the User Interaction Flow and State Management diagrams to understand how new features should integrate with existing patterns.
- **For Data Updates**: Refer to the Data Model diagram when adding or modifying content.
- **For Technical Documentation**: Use all diagrams as reference material when documenting the application.

These diagrams serve as living documentation that should be updated as the application evolves to maintain their usefulness as a reference resource.
