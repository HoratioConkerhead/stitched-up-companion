# "Stitched Up" by Matt Parry' - Structured Analysis

## Overall Design Approach

For an interactive app exploring this novel, I recommend structuring the data to allow users to:

1. **Navigate chronologically** through the story
2. **Explore character relationships** and development
3. **Track locations** and movement
4. **Follow spy networks** and allegiances
5. **Visualize the mystery** as it unfolds
