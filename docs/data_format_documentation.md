# Interactive Reading Companion - Data Format Documentation

This document describes the data format for the Interactive Reading Companion app and provides guidance for adding new books to the series.

## Data Structure

The app uses a modular data structure organized by book with domain-specific files:

```
/src/data/
  /bookName/
    index.js              // Optional. Recommended to export a neutral `book` object
    characters.js         // Character data
    locations.js          // Location data
    events.js             // Event data
    objects.js            // Object data
    relationships.js      // Character relationship data (optional; can be derived from characters.relations)
    positions.js          // Geographic positions and map data
    mysteryElements.js    // Mystery-specific elements
    chapters.js           // Chapter information
    spycraftEntries.js    // Spycraft technique data
    themeElements.js      // Thematic elements
    metadata.js           // Book metadata and app configuration (required for discovery)
  /book2Name/
    ... same structure ...
```

Discovery is automatic at runtime. The app scans each book folder for `metadata.js` (for selection info) and `index.js` (for full data). No app code changes are required when adding a new book.

## Global Chapter Introduction Field

To enable a universal “show up to chapter” view, every data entity MUST include an `introducedInChapter` field indicating the earliest chapter where that entity is first mentioned or becomes relevant. This applies to characters, relationships (at the edge level), locations, events, objects, spycraft entries, theme elements, and mystery elements.

Rules:
- Use chapter ids from the book’s `chapters.js` (e.g., `chapter_01`).
- For relationships, `introducedInChapter` is the chapter the relationship begins and cannot be earlier than either character’s own `introducedInChapter`.
- UI components should filter based on this field to avoid spoilers.

## Data Format Per Type

### Character Data Format
```javascript
export const characters = [
  {
    id: 'character_id',           // Unique identifier
    name: 'Character Name',       // Full character name
    title: 'Title',               // Optional: Character's title (e.g., 'Lady', 'Colonel')
    group: 'Group',               // Character affiliation ('Protagonists', 'Antagonists', etc.)
    role: 'Description of role',  // Character's role in the story
    background: 'Background...',  // Character's background information
    personality: 'Personality traits description',
    traits: ['Trait1', 'Trait2'], // Array of character traits
    relations: [                  // Array of relationships used to derive edges
      { 
        characterId: 'related_character_id', 
        type: 'relationship_type', 
        description: 'Detailed description of relationship',
        introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id' // Required: when THIS relation starts
      }
    ],
    development: [                // Character development through the story
      { 
        phase: 'Beginning', 
        description: 'Description of character at this phase' 
      }
    ],
    aliases: ['Alias1', 'Alias2'], // Optional: Alternate names or disguises
    fate: 'Character's ultimate fate', // Optional: What happens to character by the end
    key_scenes: ['scene_id_1', 'scene_id_2'], // Optional: Important scenes for this character
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id' // Required: chapter where character is first introduced
  }
];
```

### Character Importance Rating System (Metadata-driven)

The RelationshipWeb component calculates a 1-100 importance rating per character using weights configured in `bookMetadata.importanceWeights`. If not provided, sensible defaults are used. Schema:

```javascript
importanceWeights: {
  keyScenes: { perItem: number, max: number },
  eventParticipation: { perItem: number, max: number },
  relationships: { perItem: number, max: number },
  development: { perItem: number, max: number },
  defaultGroupBonus: number,
  groupBonuses: { [groupName: string]: number }
}
```

Example defaults (can be overridden per book):
- keyScenes: perItem 6, max 30
- eventParticipation: perItem 2.5, max 25
- relationships: perItem 2, max 20
- development: perItem 2.5, max 10
- defaultGroupBonus: 3
- groupBonuses: { Protagonists: 15, Fifth Columnists: 12, Military: 10, Historical Figures: 10, German Connection: 8, Supporting Characters: 5 }

This system helps readers understand character prominence and can be displayed as a number above nodes.

**Chapter-Based Filtering**: Characters can be filtered by their introduction chapter, allowing the relationship web to show only characters and relationships relevant up to a specific point in the story. This prevents spoilers and enables progressive revelation of the narrative.

### Location Data Format
```javascript
export const locations = [
  {
    id: 'location_id',            // Unique identifier
    name: 'Location Name',        // Location name
    area: 'Geographic area',      // Region/country/city
    type: 'Location type',        // E.g., 'Country house', 'Military facility'
    features: [                   // Physical characteristics
      'Feature description 1',
      'Feature description 2'
    ],
    significance: [               // Plot significance
      'Significance point 1',
      'Significance point 2'
    ],
    description: 'Detailed description of location',
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id', // Required: earliest chapter where this location becomes relevant
    events: [                     // Events that occurred at this location
      { eventId: 'event_id', role: 'setting/critical_location/etc.' }
    ],
    occupants: [                  // Characters associated with location
      { characterId: 'character_id', relationship: 'owner/resident/etc.' }
    ],
    rooms: [                      // Optional: Specific areas within location
      { name: 'Room name', significance: 'Room significance' }
    ],
    proximity: [                  // Optional: Nearby locations
      { locationId: 'nearby_location_id', description: 'Relationship to this location' }
    ],
    owner: 'Owner name'           // Optional: Property owner information
  }
];
```

### Event Data Format
```javascript
export const events = [
  {
    id: 'event_id',               // Unique identifier
    title: 'Event Title',         // Name of the event
    date: 'Event date/timeframe', // When it happened
    description: 'Event description',
    location: 'location_id',      // Where it happened (references location id)
    characters: [                 // Who was involved
      { 
        characterId: 'character_id', 
        role: 'role in event',
        disguise: 'optional disguise during event' 
      }
    ],
    significance: 'Event significance to plot',
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id', // Required: chapter where event first occurs/appears
    keyActions: [                  // Important actions during event
      'Action description 1',
      'Action description 2'
    ]
  }
];
```

### Relationship Data Format (Derived or Explicit)
```javascript
export const relationships = [
  {
    from: 'character_id_1',       // Character initiating relationship
    to: 'character_id_2',         // Target character
    type: 'relationship-type',    // Nature of relationship (e.g., 'handler-asset', 'spouse')
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id' // NEW: Chapter where relationship is first introduced
  }
];
```

Notes:
- This file is optional. If omitted, relationships are automatically derived from `characters[].relations` by pairing both sides and combining their `type` values (e.g., `employer` + `confidante` → `employer-confidante`).
- If `introducedInChapter` is not provided at the relation level, the derived relationship uses the earliest of the two characters' `introducedInChapter` values.
- Providing an explicit `relationships.js` is supported but not required.

**Chapter-Based Filtering**: Relationships can be filtered by their introduction chapter, enabling the relationship web to progressively reveal connections as the reader progresses through the story. This prevents spoilers and creates a dynamic reading experience where the network grows chapter by chapter.

### Object Data Format
```javascript
export const objects = [
  {
    id: 'object_id',              // Unique identifier
    name: 'Object Name',          // Name of the object
    type: 'Object type',          // Category (e.g., 'Weapon', 'Document')
    description: 'Description of object',
    physical_details: 'Physical appearance',
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id', // Required: earliest chapter where object is introduced
    technical_details: [          // Optional specific characteristics
      'Technical detail 1',
      'Technical detail 2'
    ],
    significance: [               // Importance to the plot
      'Significance point 1',
      'Significance point 2'
    ],
    history: [                    // Object's journey through the story
      { event: 'Event name', details: 'What happened with the object' }
    ],
    possessors: [                 // Characters who possessed the object
      { 
        characterId: 'character_id', 
        period: 'early/mid/late', 
        alias: 'Optional alias during possession' 
      }
    ],
    appearances: [                // Events where the object appears
      'event_id_1', 'event_id_2'
    ],
    image_description: 'Description of what the object looks like' // For visualization
  }
];
```

    type: "uk/german/irish" 
  }
};

      { lat: 51.5000, lon: -1.2000, label: "Point 2" }
    ]
  }
};

// Character last known positions
export const characterPositions = {
  'character_id': { locationId: 'location_id' }
};

// Object positions
export const objectPositions = {
  'object_id': { locationId: 'location_id' }
};

// Map boundaries for different regions
export const mapBoundaries = {
  'uk': { bounds: [[49.0, -8.0], [61.0, 2.0]] },
  'german': { bounds: [[47.0, 5.0], [55.0, 15.0]] }
};
```

    description: 'Description of the theme',
    introducedInChapter: 'chapter_id', // Required: earliest chapter where theme is made explicit
    examples: [                   // Examples from the story

    ],
    relatedCharacters: ['character_id_1', 'character_id_2'],

```

## Adding a New Book

To add a new book to the series (no rebuild needed):

1. Create a new folder in `/src/data/` with the book's name (e.g., `/src/data/MyBook/`).
2. Add a `metadata.js` file exporting `bookMetadata` (required for discovery and selection UI).
3. Add data files as needed: `characters.js`, `events.js`, `locations.js`, `objects.js`, `relationships.js` (optional), `positions.js`, `mysteryElements.js`, `chapters.js`, `spycraftEntries.js`, `themeElements.js`.
4. Recommended: create an `index.js` that exports a neutral `book` object aggregating your data. The loader will also accept a named `stitchedUp` export or a default export. If `index.js` is omitted, the loader will automatically assemble the book object from the individual files.
5. Refresh the browser. The app rescans on load and the new book appears in the selector.

Example `index.js` (recommended):

```javascript
// /src/data/MyBook/index.js
import { characters } from './characters.js';
import { events } from './events.js';
import { locations } from './locations.js';
import { objects } from './objects.js';
import { chapters } from './chapters.js';
import { timeline } from './timeline.js';
import { mysteryElements } from './mysteryElements.js';
import { themeElements } from './themeElements.js';
import { spycraftEntries } from './spycraftEntries.js';
import { bookMetadata } from './metadata.js';
import { locationPositions, eventPositions, characterPositions, objectPositions, mapBoundaries } from './positions.js';

export const book = {
  bookMetadata,
  characters,
  events,
  locations,
  objects,
  chapters,
  timeline,
  mysteryElements,
  themeElements,
  spycraftEntries,
  locationPositions,
  eventPositions,
  characterPositions,
  objectPositions,
  mapBoundaries
};
```

Loader behavior:
- Prefers `export const book = {...}`
- Falls back to `export const stitchedUp = {...}` or `export default {...}`
- If no `index.js`, it aggregates named exports from per-type files

## Using the Data in Components

Components can import data in two ways:

1. Import all data from a specific book:
```javascript
import { bookName } from '../data';
// Use: bookName.characters, bookName.events, etc.
```

2. Import specific data types directly:
```javascript
import { characters, events } from '../data/bookName';
// Use: characters, events directly
```

Choose the approach that works best for your component's needs.

## Data Validation

When creating data files, ensure:

1. **Unique IDs**: All IDs must be unique within their category
2. **Valid References**: All references to other entities (characterId, locationId, eventId) must exist
3. **Required Fields**: Required fields are marked above, optional fields are noted
4. **Data Consistency**: Character groups, relationship types, and other enums should be consistent across files
5. **Geographic Accuracy**: Coordinates in positions.js should be accurate for mapping functionality

## Chapter-Based Filtering System

The application supports progressive revelation of content based on the reader's progress through the story. This system prevents spoilers and creates a dynamic experience where the narrative network grows chapter by chapter.

### Implementation Details

**Character Introduction Tracking**:
- Each character includes an `introducedInChapter` field indicating when they first appear
- Characters can be filtered to show only those introduced up to a specific chapter
- This enables the relationship web to progressively add new characters

**Relationship Timeline Tracking**:
- Each relationship includes an `introducedInChapter` field indicating when it's established
- Relationships can be filtered to show only those relevant up to a specific chapter
- This prevents revealing connections before they're established in the story

**Filtering Behavior**:
- **Character Explorer**: Can limit character list to those introduced up to current chapter
- **Relationship Web**: Can show only characters and relationships relevant to current chapter
- **Timeline**: Can limit events to those occurring up to current chapter
- **Location Explorer**: Can filter locations based on when they become relevant
- **Object Gallery**: Can show only objects introduced up to current chapter

### Benefits

1. **Spoiler Prevention**: Readers can explore the app without encountering future plot developments
2. **Progressive Discovery**: The narrative network grows organically as the story progresses
3. **Reading Companion**: Perfect for readers who want to explore as they read
4. **Post-Reading Analysis**: Full network available after completing the book
5. **Educational Use**: Teachers can control how much information students see

### Usage Examples

```javascript
// Filter characters by chapter
const charactersUpToChapter = characters.filter(char => 
  char.introducedInChapter <= currentChapter
);

// Filter relationships by chapter
const relationshipsUpToChapter = relationships.filter(rel => 
  rel.introducedInChapter <= currentChapter
);

// Get all content for a specific chapter
const chapterContent = {
  characters: characters.filter(char => char.introducedInChapter === chapterId),
  relationships: relationships.filter(rel => rel.introducedInChapter === chapterId),
  events: events.filter(event => event.chapter === chapterId)
};
```

### Future Enhancements

The chapter-based system is designed to be extensible for future features:

1. **Progressive Character Information**: Different character details revealed at different chapters
2. **Relationship Evolution**: Track how relationships change over time
3. **Location Discovery**: Progressive revelation of location significance
4. **Object History**: Show object movement and significance progressively
5. **Theme Development**: Track how themes emerge and develop throughout the story
