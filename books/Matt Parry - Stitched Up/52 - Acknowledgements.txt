This project started many years ago. 
Having written a number of successful academic books for him, my friend and publisher, Paul Holness, challenged me to write a novel as it was a style of writing I was not used to. He didn’t think I would do it…well, although it is years past the deadline…here it is.  The Coronavirus lockdown has given me the opportunity to find a block of time where I could once again get back into the routine of writing. It may not be a prize winner, but it was a cathartic experience and helped save my sanity during some of the dark days.  
Thanks Paul.

I would also like to thank Sue Nicholson and Sue Ball who commented on the individual chapters as I wrote them… I admire their resilience.
